# flower-store-web-app
### Changes made and general information:

- Implemented InventoryManagement Subdomain --> requires verification but `docker-compose build` and `docker-compose up` are running fine.
- Implemented OrderProcessing Subdomain. Some warnings appeared that prevent from running `docker-compose build`. To review...
#### NOTE:
The Order entity seems different from the Product entity. It should be reviewed.
